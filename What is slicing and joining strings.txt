What is slicing and joining strings?  

When you slice a string, you extract a subset of the original string—sometimes referred to as indexing a string. 
Joining strings is the process of linking two or more strings together to create a bigger string.


string1 = "Greetings, Earthlings"
print(string1[0])   # Prints “G”
print(string1[4:8]) # Prints “ting”
print(string1[11:]) # Prints “Earthlings”
print(string1[:5])  # Prints “Greet”


If your index is negative, Python counts back from the end of the string instead of the beginning.

print(string1[-10:])     # Prints “Earthlings” again


An optional way to slice an index is by the stride argument, indicated by using a double colon. This allows you to skip over the corresponding number of characters in your index, or if you’re using a negative stride, the string prints backwards.


print(string1[0::2])    # Prints “Getns atlns”
print(string1[::-1])    # Prints “sgnilhtraE ,sgniteerG”
