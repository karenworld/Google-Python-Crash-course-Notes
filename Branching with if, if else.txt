if statement
============

def hint_username(username):
    if len(username) < 3:
        print("Invalid username. Must be at least 3 characters long")

ifElse statement
================
def hint_username(username):
    if len(username) < 3:
        print("Invalid username. Must be at least 3 characters long")
    else:
        print("Valid username")
#This code will not have an output. 

Els statement
=============
def is_even(number):
    if number % 2 == 0:
        return True
    return False
#This code has no ouput

The code below using nested else if make it hard to read therefore Python come up with elif
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
def hint_username(username):
    if len(username) < 3:
        print("Invalid username. Must be at least 3 characters long")
    else:
        if len(username) > 15:
            print("Invalid username. Must be at most 15 characters long")
        else:
            print("Valid username")

This is where the elif statement, which is short for else if, comes into play.
But before we jump into how to use it, let's take a look at why we need it in
the first place. Let's go back to our trusty username validation example.
Now, what if your company also had a rule that usernames longer than 15
characters aren't allowed?
How could we let the user know if their chosen username was too long?
We could do it like this. In this case, we're adding an extra if block inside
the else block. This works, but the way the code is nested makes it kind of hard
to read. To avoid unnecessary nesting and make the code clearer, Python gives
us the elif keyword, which lets us handle more than two comparison cases.
Take a look. The elif statement looks very similar to the if statement.
It's followed by a condition and a colon, and a block of code indented to
the right that forms the body.
The condition must be true for the body of the elif block to be executed.
The main difference between elif and if statements is we can only write an elif
block as a companion to an if block.
That's because the condition of the elif statement will only be checked if
the condition of the if statement wasn't true.
So in this example, the program first checks whether the username is less than
three characters long, and prints a message if that's the case.
If the username has at least three characters, the program then checks if
it's longer than 15 characters.
If it is, we get a message to tell us that.
Finally, if none of the above conditions were met, the program prints
a message indicating that the username is valid. 


elif statements
===============
def hint_username(username):
    if len(username) < 3:
        print("Invalid username. Must be at least 3 characters long")
    elif len(username) > 15:
        print("Invalid username. Must be at most 15 characters long")
    else:
        print("Valid username")
