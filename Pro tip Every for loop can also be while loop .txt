Pro tip: Every for loop can also be written as a while loop. 

Let’s see what that looks like. In the example below, we’re using a for loop to print out the characters in the string “Hello.”

>>> greeting = "Hello"

>>> for c in greeting:

>>>   print("The next character is: ", c)

The next character is: H 

The next character is: e 

The next character is: l 

The next character is: l 

The next character is: o

Notice that the for loop will stop iterating after the “o” is printed. You can also use for loops with Python’s range () function to generate a series of numbers, which you can see in the following example:

>>> for i in range(0, 3):

>>>   print("The next value is:” i)

The next value is 0 

The next value is 1 

The next value is 2
