How to join strings ?

print("Hello" + " " + "world") #Prints “Hello world”


greetings = ["Hello", "world"]
print(" ".join(greetings))  # Prints "Hello world"
You can also concatenate a combination of strings and variables like in the following example.
name = "Alice"
print("Hello, " + name + "!")  # Prints "Hello, Alice!"


How to combine slicing and joining strings

Now you know how to slice strings and join strings. 
Now, let’s put the two operations together by taking an unformatted phone number, 2025551212, 
and return it as a properly formatted U.S. number. In this example, we’ll use phonenum to refer to the unformatted phone number.


# The first 3 digits are the area code:
  area_code = "(" + phonenum[:3] + ")"

# The next 3 digits are called the “exchange”:
  exchange = phonenum[3:6]


# The next 3 digits are the line number:
  line = phonenum[-4:]# Put the pieces back together into a nicely formatted string:
  return area_code + " " + exchange + "-" + line


def format_phone(phonenum):
    area_code = "(" + phonenum[:3] + ")"
    exchange = phonenum[3:6]
    line = phonenum[-4:]
    return area_code + " " + exchange + "-" + line


print(format_phone("2025551212")) # Outputs: (202) 555-1212
