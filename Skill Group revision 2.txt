    Use the string.join() method to concatenate a string that provides a list name and its elements.


# This function accepts a list name and a list of elements, and returns
# a string with the format: "The "list_name" list includes: element1, 
# element2, element3". 
def list_elements(list_name, elements):
    # This task can be completed in a single line of code. The 
    # concatenation of strings, "list_name", and the list "elements" can
    # occur on the return line. In this case, the string "The " is added 
    # to the "list_name", plus the string " list includes: ", then the
    # "elements" are joined using a comma to separate each element of the 
    # list.
    return "The " + list_name + " list includes: " + ", ".join(elements)

print(list_elements("Printers", ["Color Printer", "Black and White Printer", "3-D Printer"]))
# Should print "The Printers list includes: Color Printer, Black and White Printer, 3-D Printer"

    Use map() and convert the map object to a list so we can print all the results at once.


# A simple function to add 1 to a given number
def add_one(number):
    return number + 1

# A list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Use map to apply the function to each element in the list
result = map(add_one, numbers)

# Convert the map object to a list to print the result
print(list(result))

# Outputs: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]



Skill Group 7

    Use zip() to combine a list of names and ages into a list of tuples, and print all the tuples at once.


 #Two lists
names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
ages = [25, 30, 35]
team = ['A', 'B', 'C']

# Use zip to combine the lists
combined = zip(names, ages, team)

# Convert the zip object to a list to print the result
print(list(combined))

# Outputs: [('Alice', 25), ('Bob', 30), ('Charlie', 35)]
