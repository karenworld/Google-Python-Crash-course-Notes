Write a for loop with a three parameter range() function that prints the multiples of 7 between 0 and 100. 
Print one multiple per line and avoid printing any numbers that aren't multiples of 7. 
Remember that 0 is also a multiple of 7. 


for x in range(0, 101, 7): 
    if x%7 == 0: #remember to have indentation and also put a :
        print(x*7)
